The major driver for applying for these loans are debt consolidations, unstated reasons, home improvements and finally business related. Prosper has a system of rating each loan application it receives, and it generally consists of intermediate risk investments. Loan applications with $5K as monthly income have a higher tendency of paying up their borrowed loans.\n",
    "Futher insights reveal that borrower rate is a major determinant of both Loan Status and Prosper rating. The lower the rate the more likely the loan will be paid and in due time, in likewise manner the a lower risk score will be assigned, the converse also is very much true.\n"
